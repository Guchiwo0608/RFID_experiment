These data is the result of measurement for near-field phase optimization.

The vertical distance between antenna and tags is 1.3m.
A tag was moved and the measurement data will be used for localization using NFPO method with tag array.
The data is collected at each 0.1m space from 2.0m to 0m.
Max Throughput is used for these communications' signal encoder.
